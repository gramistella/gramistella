Rust-focused engineer. I build backends, pipelines, and small tools that actually run.  
I’m not a visual/UI designer; I keep UIs minimal and functional. ![](https://hit.yhype.me/github/profile?user_id=60039721)

- Location: Italy
- Tools: Rust (axum, sqlx, tokio, tower, tracing, utoipa), SQL (Postgres/SQLite), Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, Amazon S3, Python (utilities)
