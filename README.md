# G. Ramistella

![](https://hit.yhype.me/github/profile?user_id=60039721)

Rust-focused engineer. I build backends, pipelines, and small tools that actually run.  
I’m not a visual/UI designer; I keep UIs minimal and functional.

- Location: Italy
- Tools: Rust, SQL (Postgres/SQLite), Docker Compose, GitHub Actions, Amazon S3, Python (utilities)

## What I focus on
- APIs, auth, data models, migrations, testing
- Bots, scraping, storage, and integrations
- Taking a blank repo to something deployable

## What I don’t focus on
- Visual/UI design. Function over style.

## Working together
Open to Rust backend/platform work with small teams.  
Remote is fine; EU relocation possible. Open to visa sponsorship for other locations. Contract or full-time.
