## Active projects

### 📊 [df-derive](https://github.com/gramistella/df-derive)
Derive macro that turns your Rust structs into Polars `DataFrame`s—fast, zero-boilerplate.
- Generates `ToDataFrame` + efficient columnar `[T]` conversion
- Flattens nested structs; supports `Option`, `Vec`, tuple structs, `DateTime<Utc>`, `Decimal`
- Schema introspection + `#[df_derive(as_string)]` for enum/string outputs

### 🧮 [paft](https://github.com/paft-rs/paft)
Provider-agnostic financial types for Rust; a compact foundation for provider adapters.
- Standardized models (instruments, quotes/candles, money, options, fundamentals)
- Swap data providers without touching your analysis or app code

### 💹 [yfinance-rs](https://github.com/gramistella/yfinance-rs)
Ergonomic Rust client for Yahoo Finance, an async-first rewrite inspired by the popular Python library.
- Historical prices, real-time streaming, options, fundamentals, and company info
- Async-first API using **tokio** and **reqwest**
- High-level `Ticker` interface for ease of use
- Builder pattern for complex queries

### 🧱 [cornerstone](https://github.com/gramistella/cornerstone)
A practical starter for writing business logic from day one.
- Rust backend (**axum**, **SQLx**) with typed shared code; auth with refresh tokens
- Migrations for **SQLite** and **Postgres**
- Tests, Docker Compose, CI
- Optional frontends: **Svelte (web)** or **Slint (desktop)**

### 🧵 [stitch](https://github.com/gramistella/stitch)
Context manager for LLM workflows, now rewritten in **Rust + Slint** with a fast, native UI.
